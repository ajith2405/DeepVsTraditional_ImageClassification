Introduction:
This research delves into the comparative evaluation of deep learning and traditional machine learning models in the context of a binary image classification assignment. The primary objective is to categorize images into two distinct classes based on their content, facilitating a comprehensive assessment of model efficacy. The study specifically scrutinizes the performance of a deep learning classifier against three traditional machine learning models to discern their respective strengths and weaknesses in tackling this image classification task.

Dataset:
The dataset employed comprises images distributed across two classes: Class A and Class B. Comprising a total of N images, each class maintains an equal number of samples. These images are of dimensions MxM pixels, forming the basis for training and evaluating the various models.

Deep Learning Model:
A convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is formulated for the deep learning model, featuring convolutional layers, fully connected layers, and a final output layer tailored for binary classification. The rationale behind opting for a CNN lies in its ability to adeptly learn hierarchical representations from input images, particularly well-suited for image classification tasks.

Traditional Machine Learning Models:
In addition to the deep learning model, the study incorporates three traditional machine learning models for comparison: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest. These models rely on features extracted from images, utilizing raw pixel values as input. Each image is flattened into a 1D vector of size MxM, serving as input for the traditional machine learning models.

Results and Analysis:
Post-training and evaluation on the test set, the findings reveal the superior performance of the deep learning model. This can be attributed to its innate capability to automatically extract relevant features from raw pixel values using convolutional layers. The deep learning model excels at capturing intricate patterns and relationships within images, leading to enhanced classification accuracy.

Conversely, traditional machine learning models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest hinge on handcrafted features extracted from raw pixel values. These models may struggle to encapsulate the complexity and variations present in the images, resulting in comparatively lower performance.

Conclusion:
It is essential to underscore that model performance may be contingent on the specific dataset and task at hand. In this study, the deep learning model outperforms traditional machine learning models for the designated binary image classification task. The GitHub repository encapsulating this research could be aptly named "DeepVsTraditional_ImageClassification" to succinctly convey its focus and scope.
